## Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE

![Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE](big_screenshot.png?raw=true "Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE")

Fred lives on planet Figadore in the Hercules cluster, he likes watching cat videos from planet Earth via _Parallax Shift_, but the network link has gone **OFFLINE**!

Help Fred by unlocking doors, solving puzzles and collecting cubes to pay for the entanglement repolarisation required to get his planet back online.

# Stuff I managed to add
* 2D platformer
* Full screen
* No canvas
* Works in various resolutions down to about 1366x768
* No 3rd party libraries
* All vector graphics (font bitmap rendered as vector)
* 8-bit tiny font (Repton inspired)
* Different coloured tiles per level
* Only div and span used for playfield
* CSS animations, some triggered by swapping element classes
* Simple timelines
* Retro terminal with typewriter effect
* Procedurally generated music (using frequency digraphs of Mario)
* Sound effects
* DTMF generator
* Gamepad support (for "standard" browser supported gamepads)
* Keyboard support for WASD, cursors and retro ZX;.
* Pseudo random generator inspired by BBC Micro

# Stuff I'd have done with more KBs
- [ ] More types of enemy
- [ ] Parallax scrolling backgrounds
- [ ] Better music (had to lower volume to make it more acceptable)
- [ ] Foliage or other scenery
- [ ] Support for going up stairs (this was almost working)
- [ ] Better enemy AI (more then just patrolling, perhaps jumping, line-of-sight wake up, e.t.c)
- [ ] More sound effects perhaps enhanced with envelopes
- [x] Playfield scaling
- [ ] Better game completed screen
- [x] Animate the stars to twinkle
- [ ] Enemy squash and puzzle animations

I had help choosing the main character name and planet name from my 3yr old son.
Also I had help designing some levels and play testing from Jessica Vines.
